# Literate Visualization Software

_Litvis_ as a framework for interpreting markdown documents can have multiple implementations in various programming languages.
The first working instance of litvis software has been developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed superset of JavaScript.
This implementation is available in [gicentre/mume-with-litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/mume-with-litvis) repo.
In future, it is planned to publish litvis source code as a set of small [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules, which will ease its re-use in different environments.

The easiest way to get litvis up and running is to install an Atom package available at https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis. Its source code and setup instructions can be found in [gicentre/markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis).

Alternatively, you can try a Visual Studio Code extension available at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gicentre.markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis.
The instructions and the source code are shared in [gicentre/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis).
