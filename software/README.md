# Literate Visualization Software

_Litvis_ as a framework for interpreting markdown documents can have multiple implementations in various programming languages.
The first working instance of litvis software has been developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
It is available at https://github.com/gicentre/mume-with-litvis.
In future, litvis code may be published as a set of small npm modules, which will ease its re-use in different environments.

The easiest way to get litvis up and running is to install an Atom package available at https://github.com/gicentre/markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis.

Alternatively, you can try a Visual Studio Code extension available at https://github.com/gicentre/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced-with-litvis.
