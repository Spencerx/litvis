# Literate Visualization Tutorials

This folder contains tutorials on creating litvis documents.
Although all documents are markdown files, they are all written to be viewed within a litvis editor, so please make sure you have [installed a litvis plug-in](../../software/README.md) before reading them.

*   **[elmIntroduction](elmIntroduction.md)** introduces the Elm language used for specifying visualizations in litvis.

-   **[elmVegaWalkthrough](elmVegaWalkthrough1.md)** (and subsequent chapters) shows how visualizations may be specified and shows a range of chart types and interactions possible in a litvis document.

*   **'geo' tutorials** show how geospatial data may be [specified](geoFormats.md), [imported](geoImporting.md) and [generated](geoGenerating.md) in litvis documents.
