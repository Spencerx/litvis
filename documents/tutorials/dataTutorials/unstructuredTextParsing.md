# Using Elm Parser to Process Unstructured Text

The [previous chapter](assemblyParsing.md) in this tutorial considered how to combine parsers to parse some structured input. In this chapter we will consider how to adapt the approach for less structured input.

Suppose we wished to count the number of cats mentioned in some text:

```elm {l}
input1 : String
input1 =
    "Looking out of the window I could see 3 cats and 2 dogs playing catch in the garden."
```

## Setting up the parser infrastructure

As previously we must import the [Elm parser package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/) and set up a top-level function that runs a parser and returns the result (again ignoring error handling for the moment):

```elm {l}
parse : Parser a -> String -> Maybe a
parse parser =
    P.run parser >> Result.toMaybe
```

## A simple parser

We know we are looking for numbers in our text, and until we find a number we can ignore the preceding text. Elm parser's [chompWhile](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#chompWhile) will proceed through the input text, character at a time, while a condition is met. In our case, that each character is not a digit and it is not a minus sign. At the point this parser succeeds, the next character to parse should be a minus sign or digit or we've reached the end of the input text.

```elm {l}
ignoredText : Parser ()
ignoredText =
    P.chompWhile (\c -> not <| (Char.isDigit c && c /= '-'))
```

The example above creates a parser that does not return a value (indicated by the empty tuple `()` for the parser's type). To extract a number we use Elm's [int](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#int) parser, which will return an integer when parsing succeeds. But we only wish to extract a number if the text following it refers to a cat. Elm parser uses two special _pipe operators_ that allow us to specify a sequence of parsers either choosing to extract what is parsed [(|=)](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#succeed) or choosing to ignore it [(|.)](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#succeed).

Using [keyword](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#keyword) to look for specific words performs a one character _lookahead_ after the keyword to ensure we have reached the end of the word, thus distinguishing `cat` from `catch` etc.

Putting these together with our `ignoredText` parser, we can create our cat parser to extract the value of some numeric text only if it is immediately followed by the word `cat`:

```elm {l}
catCounter1 : Parser Int
catCounter1 =
    P.succeed identity
        |. ignoredText
        |= P.int
        |. P.spaces
        |. P.keyword "cats"
        |. ignoredText
```

^^^elm m=(parse catCounter1 input1 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

The example above creates a parser of type `int` so when the parser succeeds, we need to provide an integer value. This is the one captured by the line `|= P.int`. The general rule here when using parser pipes is that the parameters expected by the parser should match the sequence of `|=` pipe operators. In this case, `P.int` returns an integer directly, so we can use `P.succeed identity` to provide the value (remembering it is the equivalent to the function `\n -> n`).

## Making the parser more flexible

Our parser works for the simple example, but what would happen if it were to parse the following sentence?

```elm {l}
input2 : String
input2 =
    "Looking out of the window I could see 1 cat and 2 dogs playing catch in the garden."
```

^^^elm m=(parse catCounter1 input2 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

The problem is that we are looking for numbers followed by the word `cats`, but we could also legitimately have the word `cat`. This is easily solved with the option [oneOf](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#oneOf) that allows us to consider alternatives in our parsing sequence:

```elm {l}
catCounter2 : Parser Int
catCounter2 =
    P.succeed identity
        |. ignoredText
        |= P.int
        |. P.spaces
        |. P.oneOf [ P.keyword "cats", P.keyword "cat" ]
```

^^^elm m=(parse catCounter2 input2 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

Let's try it with another sentence:

```elm {l}
input3 : String
input3 =
    "Looking out of the window I could see 2 dogs and 1 cat playing catch in the garden."
```

^^^elm m=(parse catCounter2 input3 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

Here we have another problem. Our parser finds the first digit `2`, sees the word following is not `cat` or `cats` so fails. What we would like it to do is not to fail but instead resume parsing from this point looking again for a number followed by `cat` or `cats`. To do this, we can change our approach slightly and introduce a new parsing concept â€“ the loop.

Firstly, rather than use [keyword](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#keyword), let's make a more general parser that can capture any word and return the text of that word:

```elm {l}
word : Parser String
word =
    P.succeed ()
        |. P.chompWhile Char.isAlpha
        |> P.getChompedString
```

Again, we use [chompWhile](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#chompWhile) but this time, rather than ignoring the chomped text, we return it with [getChompedString](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#getChompedString). This allows us to accumulate all the chomped characters in a single string that we can process with another parser.

We can modify our cat counter so that it looks for a number and then any word following it. Rather than assume the number will be an integer, we can use Elm parser's [number](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#number) parser that will handle a wider range of numeric representations. When that number is a decimal, we will round up to the nearest whole cat. We can also account for negative numbers by considering the possibility of a `-` preceding the number, in which case we negate the parsed number.

The modified cat counting parser returns a tuple comprising the number and associated word before we then [map](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#map) it into a number that will be the one we have just parsed if the word is `cat` or `cats`, but 0 if not.

```elm {l}
number : Parser Int
number =
    P.number
        { int = Just identity
        , hex = Just identity
        , octal = Just identity
        , binary = Just identity
        , float = Just ceiling
        }


catCounter3 : Parser Int
catCounter3 =
    P.succeed Tuple.pair
        |= P.oneOf
            [ P.succeed negate
                |. P.symbol "-"
                |= number
            , number
            ]
        |. P.spaces
        |= word
        |. ignoredText
        |> P.map
            (\( n, token ) ->
                if token == "cat" || token == "cats" then
                    n

                else
                    0
            )
```

We now don't want our parsing to stop when `catCounter` succeeds because if we have found a non-cat word following a number we need to continue parsing looking for cats. We can make any parser run repeatedly with [loop](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#loop).

A loop parser requires us to define a _state_ which keeps, and possibly modifies, the data we wish to extract while parsing. In our case that state is a simple integer (number of cats). The parser applied in the loop must contain at least two parsers, one of which should succeed when we wish to continue looping (`P.Loop`), the other should succeed when we have finished looping (`P.Done`).

In our case we will stop parsing when we've reached the end of the input (looking for a match with the [end](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/Parser#end) parser), but continue if we find a number-word (which might be a cat) or some ignorable text.

```elm {l}
allCats : Parser Int
allCats =
    P.loop 0 allCatsHelp


allCatsHelp : Int -> Parser (P.Step Int Int)
allCatsHelp numCats =
    P.oneOf
        [ P.succeed (numCats |> P.Done)
            |. P.end
        , P.succeed ((+) numCats >> P.Loop)
            |= catCounter3
        , P.succeed (numCats |> P.Loop)
            |. ignoredText
        ]
```

^^^elm m=(parse allCats input3 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

One further advantage of this more flexible parser is that we can accumulate the cat counts in longer passages of text where we might have multiple mentions of cats.

```elm {l}
input4 : String
input4 =
    """
On my travels I saw over 300 cats and just 1 dog.
When I returned home I was greeted by my 3 dogs, 2 parrots and ignored by my 14 cats.
They had made a bit of mess so I worked doggedly to create 1 catalogue of all broken furniture.
"""
```

^^^elm m=(parse allCats input4 |> Maybe.withDefault 0)^^^

## Parsing into a Record

It is a common task when parsing to extract a variety of data placing different components into different parts of some data structure. To illustrate, let's suppose we wish to count both the number of cats and number of dogs in some unstructured input text.

Let's make space to store those counts in a simple [Elm record](https://elm-lang.org/docs/records):

```elm {l}
type alias CatsAndDogs =
    { cats : Int, dogs : Int }
```

The only other changes required are to replace our previous instances of integer parsers with ones that handle the `CatsAndDogs` record, differentiating between numbers followed by cat(s) and numbers followed by dog(s).

```elm {l}
allAnimals : Parser CatsAndDogs
allAnimals =
    P.loop { cats = 0, dogs = 0 } allAnimalsHelp


allAnimalsHelp : CatsAndDogs -> Parser (P.Step CatsAndDogs CatsAndDogs)
allAnimalsHelp catsAndDogs =
    P.oneOf
        [ P.succeed (catsAndDogs |> P.Done)
            |. P.end
        , P.succeed
            (\animals ->
                { catsAndDogs
                    | cats = catsAndDogs.cats + animals.cats
                    , dogs = catsAndDogs.dogs + animals.dogs
                }
                    |> P.Loop
            )
            |= animalCounter
        , P.succeed (catsAndDogs |> P.Loop)
            |. ignoredText
        ]


animalCounter : Parser CatsAndDogs
animalCounter =
    P.succeed Tuple.pair
        |= P.int
        |. P.spaces
        |= word
        |. ignoredText
        |> P.map
            (\( n, token ) ->
                if token == "cat" || token == "cats" then
                    { cats = n, dogs = 0 }

                else if token == "dog" || token == "dogs" then
                    { dogs = n, cats = 0 }

                else
                    { dogs = 0, cats = 0 }
            )
```

^^^elm r=(P.run allAnimals input4)^^^

### Tests

How robust is our parser?

```elm {l}
test : Parser Int -> String -> Int -> String
test parser input expected =
    case P.run parser input of
        Ok val ->
            if val == expected then
                String.fromInt expected

            else
                "Failed: '" ++ input ++ "' expecting " ++ String.fromInt expected ++ " but produced " ++ String.fromInt val

        Err msg ->
            "Failed to parse '" ++ input ++ "'"
```
